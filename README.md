MAPPING the ROUTE to grateful living

## The Team

## The Project's Aims:
### For Users:
* To provide our users with a space to log their gratitudes, hardships and goals for the future.
### For Developers:
* To build on our working knowledge and skills of the React framework/library through implementation and utilisation of forms and React libraries such as React Pro Sidebar and React Icon, and more.

### How to use the Website:
* Download our app (coming soon!)
* Fork this repo and clone locally to your terminal.
* Run the API and the client project file locally.
* If you're a new user, create an account by inputting your name and email.
* If you're an existing user, just click on the sign in button and input your details.
* Once you're signed in, you should be able to create a new journal entry, view all your entries and also edit or delete any entry in the list.
* Once you've finished logging all of your day (or week...or year!)'s happenings, remember to sign out!
* If you've decided you no longer require a journal to document your thoughts, you can delete your account (but we'll be sad to see you go üò¢!)
